# <Status - Capmanagementllc.Partner.Socrata>

## Description

My goal when developing this script was to automate the process of checking the status of all assets of the website [Capmanagementllc Partner Socrata](https://capmanagementllc.partner.socrata.com/). This was made to add efficiency to the task of checking status for the thousands of private assets given the proper authentification.
